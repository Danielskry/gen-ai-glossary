<blockquote>
<p>Agent memory refers to an AI agent&#x27;s ability to store and recall information from previous interactions to guide future decisions and improve performance. Memory allows an agent to maintain context, recognize patterns over time, learn from feedback, and adapt to user preferences. In practice, memory often includes short-term memory that tracks the state of an ongoing conversation or task, and long-term memory that stores information across sessions for more persistent personalization and reasoning. While not all agents require memory, it becomes essential for agents that handle multi-step reasoning, goal-oriented tasks, or sustained user interaction.</p>
